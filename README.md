### Naming system:
The filenames of the scripts do not match the class names within the scripts. I've followed typical convention of naming the main file 'Main' and used appropriate names for project classes that fit within the context of the program example. This repository is intended to be used as a reference for SENG1110 students to copy/paste whole programs into their own files and run them in an IDE of their choice to see how the mechanics fit together.
